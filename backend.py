            We need to clarify some things.

            In order for our bot to make sense, it needs to have an idea of the history of our conversations.
            For that reason, we need to store each reply (both from the user and from the chatbot; for now we will
            store it
            in an array, might look into using a database in the future).

            There are 3 possible roles that an entity can have in a conversation:
                1. 'system' - this sets the tone of the chatbot and the way it will 'behave' (see below example)

                2. 'user' - self explanatory

                3. 'assistant' - this is the chatbot itself
