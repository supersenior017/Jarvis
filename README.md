# J.A.R.V.I.S

Just A Really Very Intelligent System :)

Inspired by Iron-Man's sophisticated assistant.

This project is also found inside my #machine-learning repository; I started developing it there as a side-project to get some experience with OpenAI's new API, but it grew into something that I use every single day.

Lots of improvements need to be done still, especially on the GUI side.

#IMPORTANT: THERE IS A GENERATE BUTTON AT THE BOTTOM OF THE GUI! IF YOU DONT SEE IT, TRY CHANGING THE DIMENSION OF THE GUI, EITHER BY DRAGGING ITS MARGINS OR FROM THE CODE! STILL WORKING ON THIS!

## Disclaimer: there's lots of files in here; the ones you're interested in are config.py, jarvis.py, openai_api.py and modes.py

#### > config.py - here is where you'll keep your API_KEY (see step 2-4 below).
#### > jarvis.py - GUI
#### > openai_api - consume the OpenAI API
#### > modes.py - I won't go into too much detail here (read the official docs to get a better idea); basically, this is the first message in a conversation and sets the tone for how the chatbot responds and 'behaves' for the rest of the conversation. You can add your own modes as well; make sure to go to to line 26 in openai_api.py and use whatever mode you want for your app.

## System Requirements

This will almost certainly work on any UNIX-like system that supports the OpenAI library.

I have not tested it on Windows; do so at your own peril. Also, the instructions below assume you are on a UNIX-based machine.

I am using python 3.9


## How to run it

#### 1. Install the OpenAI library

$ pip install openai

#### 2. Get your API_KEY from openai.com

Go to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create your own API_KEY.

#### 3. Create a config.py file inside the project's main folder (where jarvis.py resides)

$ touch config.py

#### 4. Add your API_KEY to the config file.

Add this line inside the config.py file: OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-api-key".

Replace 'your-api-key' with your API_KEY from step 2.

#### 5. Run it

$ python jarvis.py

#### 6. Enjoy pretending you are Iron-Man!
